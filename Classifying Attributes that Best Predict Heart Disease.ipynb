    "According to Statistics Canada, heart disease is the second leading cause of death in 2019, accounting for 18.5% of all deaths. So by using the Heart Disease data set, we will determine the three attributes (i.e. characteristics or factors) that can best predict the presence of heart disease in a person. The data set contains four datasets concerning heart-disease related characteristics, and each data set contains 14 attributes organized into 14 variables and 302 observations. All the data is of type double, and they were collected from the following institutes:\n",
